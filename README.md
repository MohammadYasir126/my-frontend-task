## About the Project

The goal of this assignment was to create a visually appealing and mobile-responsive frontend using React.  
The project includes multiple sections like Hero, Services, Hiring Process, About, Testimonials, and Footer.

Each section is built as a separate React component so the project stays organized and easy to maintain.
